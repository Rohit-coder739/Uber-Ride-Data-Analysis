#Uber Rides Data Analysis Project
This repository contains code and data for analyzing Uber rides in New York City, focusing on ride patterns based on weather conditions and specific locations. The goal is to understand how factors like temperature, rain, and location influence Uber ride demand.

Project Overview
The "Uber Rides Data Analysis" project aims to:

Calculate the number of Uber rides based on weather conditions such as temperature, rain, and other natural factors.
Analyze ride distribution across different locations in New York City.
Provide insights into how these conditions affect ride demand.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains Uber ride records in New York City, along with historical weather data corresponding to each ride. The data includes:

Pickup and Dropoff Locations: Latitude and Longitude coordinates of each ride.
Date and Time: Timestamps of ride requests.
Weather Conditions: Information on temperature, precipitation, and other relevant factors at the time of each ride.
Note: This dataset can be sourced from Uberâ€™s public datasets or weather APIs like OpenWeather.



Clone the Repository:

bash

cd Uber-Rides-Data-Analysis
Install Dependencies: Install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Data: Place the Uber rides and weather data CSV files in the data/ folder. You may need to preprocess the data for accurate analysis.

Run Analysis: Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to run data analysis and visualization steps:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Analysis Approach
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Remove any invalid or missing entries in the datasets.
Standardize date and location formats for consistency.
Data Analysis:

Count the number of rides based on different weather conditions and locations.
Use statistical methods to determine if weather has a significant effect on ride volume.
Data Visualization:

Generate graphs showing ride frequency based on temperature, rain, and other factors.
Plot ride distributions across various New York City neighborhoods.
Results and Insights
Weather Impact on Ride Demand: Describe findings on how weather impacts Uber ride demand.
Location-Based Analysis: Summarize ride patterns in different New York City neighborhoods.
Time-Based Trends: Show how ride demand fluctuates over time (hourly, daily, weekly).
